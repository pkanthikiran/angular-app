-- Selecting Columns

-- Write a query that shows the city in which each publisher resides.
SELECT city
FROM publishers;

-- What is the price that each title is being sold for, and how many copies have been sold of each?

-- Which cities have publishers in them (it’s ok for a city to appear more than once).

-- List all the information known about titles.

-- Is every title sold for a different price to the other titles?

-- No, some are sold for the same price.



-- Expressions

-- Write a query that returns a simple address label for each store.  The format should be something like:
